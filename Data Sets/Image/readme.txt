I've used flickr8k dataset that is available on kaggle. You can run download_data.sh shell script. Before that put kaggle.json which is kaggle api key in same directory. 
This dataset contains 8000 images each with 5 captions (as we have already seen in the Introduction section that an image can have multiple captions, all being relevant 
simultaneously).

These images are bifurcated as follows:

Training Set — 6000 images
Dev Set — 1000 images
Test Set — 1000 images
